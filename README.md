Chelsea Apps Factory - Developer Challenge



## How to run the app
In order to run the app you'll need Visual Studio 15 as it uses C# 6 features.

1. If you want to test it with a different dataset replace the contents of **data.csv**.
2. Run the console app (**CA.App**)

For simplicity the app is configured to write the results into the console instead of a CSV file.
